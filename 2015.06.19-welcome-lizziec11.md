Hello, I'm Elizabeth. 
This is my first time learning how to code. We started with worksheet markdown 
and it was great. 
I'm getting to know more and I'm super happy
I think coding is cool and I want to be good at it. I'm excited about the  YWEBCA program and I hope to come out of it with coding skills need. 
I look forward to next weeks!
