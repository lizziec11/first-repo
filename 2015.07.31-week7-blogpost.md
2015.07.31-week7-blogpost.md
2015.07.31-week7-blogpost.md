This week I'm still confused. I'm trying not to give up. 
I'm working really hard to get it but I keep getting stuck all over again. 
I still have a lot of work to finish up. I'm frustrated, confused and stressed. Any help would do at this point. 
I'm still hanging in there because I really want to know this stuff. 
A little direction will help a lot. I have tried different coding apps and code school on my own.
They help a little but when I try to apply what I learned to my homework, I find it difficult. I'm worried but hopeful that week 8 will be better.
