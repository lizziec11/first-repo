week 4 blog post


This week I feel more lost then ever. 
I'm starting to think that I'm going to fail this class.
I don't know what to do anymore. 
No matter what I do, I don't feel like I can keep up with everyone in the class.
It is frustrating to see that even with all my effort, I am still behind on my worksheet.
