week six i'm still having a hard time but i'm getting as much help as i can. There is so much work to do and 
i've been really depressed for weeks but i'm
trying to count my blessings instead of complaining about what is going wrong in my life.
I'm dealing with some personal issues which is getting in the way of stuffs that I'm learning. 
It is difficult for me to understand alot of the concepts 
and it is adding to my frustration. 
Even with the help i've got, I still have a lot of work to do.
