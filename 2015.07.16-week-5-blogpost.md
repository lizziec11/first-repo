Week 5 is not so bad I'm lost but not with everything.
Things are starting to make sense little by little.
Beginning to learn things on my own as much as I can
but I could use more help.
If I have a partner who can help with explaining things to me, I  will be able to know more.
I will use what I learn to my work.
Learning on my own is good but sometimes I get lost and I cannot get others to explain things to me.
I am doing all I can to be better but more help would go a long way me.
