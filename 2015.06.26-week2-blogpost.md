Week 2 to me was hard, but I think I'm starting to learn something. I'm just happy that I'm not as lost as i was the first day I started. The JS online book helped a lot. So far I'm happy with this YWEBCA.I will try read more of the online book to get my stuff done. Things are hard because I am just learning the language of coding. The book is helping me a little bit but I still need extra help. I'm happy to be a part of the program and I hope next week will be better. Week 3 here come!!
