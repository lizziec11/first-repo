Week #3
week three was very hard for me chapter 2 was not easy 
i just wish to have someone that we can work together with than to be doing it
all by myself. I feel that we are going too fast with chapter 2 and it is becoming difficult to catch up. The chapter has a lot of ideas that are not clear.
I don't have a foundation in coding so i need more help with the chapter. I hope week 4 will be better.
