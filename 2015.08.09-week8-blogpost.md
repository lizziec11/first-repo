Week 8 is better than last week. 
I was able to get help through extra class on the weekend. 
I'm really happy to learn how to answer some difficult questions.
The class helped me to understand a big part of my work that I find really hard.
I'm learning to solve part of my work but I still have a long way to go. 
I hope next week will be better or at least, as good as this week.
